Illenium - It's All On U

At first I didn't think that I was cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets getting swallowed by the sea
Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know
With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
Can't see, dark road, driving up the hills
Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got no where to go, but we can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know
With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
And it's all on you
And it's all on you
And it's all on you
